    "Consider the scenario of teaching a dog new tricks. The dog doesn't understand our language, so we can't tell him what to do. Instead, we follow a different strategy. We emulate a situation (or a cue), and the dog tries to respond in many different ways. If the dog's response is the desired one, we reward them with snacks. Now guess what, the next time the dog is exposed to the same situation, the dog executes a similar action with even more enthusiasm in expectation of more food. That's like learning \"what to do\" from positive experiences. Similarly, dogs will tend to learn what not to do when face with negative experiences.\n",

    "That's exactly how Reinforcement Learning works in a broader sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your dog is an \"agent\" that is exposed to the <b>environment</b>. The environment could in your house, with you.\n",
    "- The situations they encounter are analogous to a <b>state</b>. An example of a state could be your dog standing and you use a specific word in a certain tone in your living room\n",
    "- Our agents react by performing an <b>action</b> to transition from one \"state\" to another \"state,\" your dog goes from standing to sitting, for example.\n",
    "- After the transition, they may receive a <b>reward or penalty</b> in return. You give them a treat! Or a \"No\" as a penalty.\n",
    "- The <b>policy</b> is the strategy of choosing an action given a state in expectation of better outcomes."
